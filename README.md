### Summary
This agent-based model was developed as part of my thesis for the MSc Engineering and Policy Analysis at the Delft University of Technology. The model aim is analyze the impact of real-time pricing and different price- and incentive-based interventions on the consumer participation in demand response. The model represents energy consumers in a future highly renewable electricity network. The consumers can choose different contract types that state if and how much demand may be shifted automatically by the energy provider in times of energy shortage.
